## Introduction

With the sprawl of the urbanized communities, today's houses have large lawns that demand constant upkeep. Such a manual an repetitive task is not only laborious but also taxing and truly unnecessary. Robot are great at performing complex repetitive tasks autonomously, and as this this is a great problem that can be solved using autonomous systems.

We propose to implement a robust robotic system in Gazebo and ROS inspired by an autonomous lawn mower called “Automower” which is capable of mowing a desired lawn area, following a predefined pattern to cut the lawn and dynamically avoid obstacles. This product would serve a long term project for ACME's robotics division and would be an ideal way to utilize the recent capital infusion in the department. Assuming an environment map known beforehand, our robot uses the TurtleBot robot as its base platform as it follows its trajectory for mowing the lawn.

Our system is built using C++ and will leverage the ROS Navigation stack for performing autonomous navigation.

## Project Collaterals

## System Architecture

The following shows the activity diagram for our proposed schema :

## Dependencies
- ROS Melodic : installation instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
- Ubuntu 18.04
- C++ Version 14+
- cmake minimum version 3.0.2
- turtlebot3 packages
### Steps to install dependencies
Run the following commands to install the dependencies required:
1. Installing the ROS navigation stack:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-navigation
```
2. Installing the turtlebot3 dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-turtlebot3 ros-melodic-turtlebot3-msgs ros-melodic-turtlebot3-navigation ros-melodic-turtlebot3-simulations
```
## Install the ALM package
Make a catkin workspace catkin_ws and run the following commands :

    cd <path_to_ws>/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/aditiramadwar/Autonomous_Lawn_Mower.git
    cd ../
    catkin_make

## Steps to run the simulation using the launch file

1. In one terminal run :
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch alm spawn.launch
```
This spawns the turtlebot3 simulation in the custom world environment on the green lawn.

*Fig 2 : Spawn the robot in the world*

2. In a second terminal run the following to bring up the mowing routine node:
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch alm mower.launch
```
This executes the lawn mowing simulation and bring up rviz for visualization of the different parameters.

3. In a third terminal run the following to start up the UI Node on the terminal:
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch alm teleop_alm.launch
```

### User Interface commands to control the robot

1. Press 's' key to start the entire trajectory tracking
2. Press 'p' key to pause the robot after it reaches the next desired trajectory point.
3. Press 'r' key to resume the trajectory tracking from the point where it was paused.
4. Press 'e' key to stop the robot immediately in case of a critical issue.

### Rosbag functionality
By default the rosbag recording is _disabled_, to enable the recording, run this:

    roslaunch alm mower.launch record:=true
Inspecting the recorded rosbag file: stop the launch file and run this,
```
rosbag info results/ros_bag_pub_sub.bag
```
## Unit Testing
Unit Testing is used to test each submodule and ensure complete code coverage. For this Google test (gtest) has been leveraged and identical test classes and methods are created with minimal modification in order to facilitate testing.
To run the test cases, terminate the above three processes and run the following in a new terminal:

    catkin_make tests
    catkin_make test
or  
    
    roslaunch alm test.launch
A unit test to check the mowing functionality has been implemented which feeds a test waypoint file and checks for the number of successful points navigated.

Since coveralls could not be integrated due to Travis issues, we have manually checked for the code coverage. With the unit tests written, all the functions of the NavigationUtils and LawnMower class are being executed during testing which by our estimates, bring our coverage to nearly 90%.

## Running cpplint & cppcheck tests

Run the following command in the root directory to generate cpplint results in **results** folder

    sh run_cpplint.sh

Run the following command in the root directory to generate cppcheck results in **results** folder

    sh run_cppcheck.sh
  ## Doxygen Documentation
